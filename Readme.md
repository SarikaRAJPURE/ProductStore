# Organic & Natural Produce Store
### By: Sarika Rajpure
## Motivation

My motivation for this store was to bring everyone together while they explore different fresh ,organic produce across the globe. This web app is useful for suppliers to create and list a product on my website. So, potential costumers can buy products from my site.

### THE STORE
